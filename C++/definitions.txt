The translation we are referring to is made by a specialized computer program called a compiler. 
The process of translating from a high-level language into a machine language is called compilation.

 the main task is to write a program in accordance with the rules of the chosen programming language.
 Such a program (which in fact is just text) is called the source code,
 or simply source, while the file which contains the source is called the source file.

type of structured and semi-formal description of each step of the program is called an algorithm.

A set of preliminary information that the compiler needs is included in header files.

In the C++ language, all elements of the standard C++ infrastructure are declared inside the namespace called std.
